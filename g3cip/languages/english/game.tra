@1000 = ~Akkabar's Battleblade~
@1001 = ~The rulers of the Shoon Imperium possessed unique magical rings known as Qysari Rings. The term "qysar," meaning "emperor," was adopted by Amahl Shoon III, the first in a line of imperial rulers. These rings were a subset of shoonrings, magical rings crafted in the Shoon Imperium during Calimshan's sixth age (27 – 450 DR). Shoonrings were distinguished by their specific construction and enchantment methods. According to the slave scribe Rativ ym Shoon, who documented the rings in 356 DR, there were twelve known Qysari Rings. This information was later included in "The Magics of the South" by Zatan Arrowswift, the Herald of Athkatla. However, only ten rings are currently described, with two of those having uncertain origins. 

Akkabar's legendary ring, known as the battleblade ring, held the distinction of being the inaugural Qysari Ring. This remarkable artifact possessed the ability to conjure a barrier of blades when activated by a specific verbal command.

@1008 = ~Vine Shield~
@1009 = ~This extraordinary shield is woven from living vines that twist and writhe as if imbued with a life of their own. Over four centuries ago, it was purchased in Sigil, the City of Doors, by a merchant who dealt with an unknown giant race from a distant realm. The shield made its way to Faerûn, where it was acquired by the ranger Elric of the High Forest. Elric used the shield to protect his village from a band of gnoll raiders, the vines ensnaring his foes and turning the tide of battle.

After years of vigilant service, Elric gifted the shield to his apprentice, a young druid named Sylvana. She carried it into the depths of the Cormanthor, where she defended the sacred glades for many years. Sylvana was later ambushed by drow scouts; though she fought valiantly, she was slain, and the shield was taken into the Underdark. There, the shield was sold to a duergar merchant, who traded it to a surface dwarf named Thrain in exchange for rare gemstones.

Thrain brought the shield back to Mithral Hall, where it was wielded by his brother Balin during skirmishes with goblin tribes. In one fierce encounter, Balin fell, and the shield was lost in the chaos. Years later, it resurfaced in the hands of a human mercenary, Katarina of Amn, who claimed to have won it in a game of Dragon Dice. Katarina utilized the shield's entangling vines to capture bounties alive, increasing her notoriety.

Her luck ran out when she was defeated in combat by the paladin Sir Reginald of Athkatla, who took the shield as a prize but found its wild nature incompatible with his disciplined fighting style. He sold it to a Calishite trader, who in turn lost it to pirates off the Sword Coast. The pirate captain, Redbeard Rufus, used the shield during boarding actions until his ship was sunk by a storm, and the shield was believed lost at sea.

Decades later, the Vine Shield washed ashore near Baldur's Gate and was found by a young adventurer. Its journey continues, the living vines ever eager to ensnare new foes, its history etched in the legends of those who have wielded it.

After the prayer, a ball of fire fell from the skies, striking the barn, and killing most of his livestock. The man refused to believe that the Moonmaiden would cause such misfortune, so he looked in the debris to see a sign from the goddess. A meteorite was found to be the cause of the impact, and on it scraps of a metal that he believed to be silver, which he related instantly to Selûne. He brought the metal to the temple, where the monks could bless it. Impressed by the shepherd's unwavering faith, they took him in, and taught him the ways of the servants of Selûne. Over time, the new recruit was able to raise enough wealth for the monastery to commission a holy weapon made from the blessed metal. A blacksmith, combining the meteorite's celestial metal with pure silver, forged seven flawless daggers, each representing one of the seven stars in Selûne’s holy symbol.

This griddle harnesses their strength and endurance providing a strength and constitution bonus to who ever wears. the bonus is more pronounced with the Urdunnirin's dwarven kin.

The girdle itself looks very plain but robust, made of thick sturdy but ashen grey leather it seems quite unremarkable until worn where it provides surprising strength and vigour. It is also noticeably heavy to carry but not wear.

@1029 = ~The Realmshaper's Brush~
@1030 = ~Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago." Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule. There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.
