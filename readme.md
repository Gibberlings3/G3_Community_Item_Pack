# The G3 Community Item Pack

## Overview

For aspiring modders, one of the things I always recommend as a first project is an item pack. It gives you a little bit of experience making items, creatures, stores, and some basic scripting and dialogue. As part of the Baldur’s Gate Community Creative Craziness Challenge, I did just this. As a tutorial live stream and collaborative project, creating items submitted by you. 

Welcome to the G3 Community Item Pack, a WeiDU compilation of items submitted by players, and created (for the most part) live on stream to showcase how to make Infinity Engine mods. The items are intended for Baldur's Gate II, original or Enhanced Edition. You can view the mod being created with this playlist, including the very typing of this sentence.
